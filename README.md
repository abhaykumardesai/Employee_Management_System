## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Java Swing
* **Backend:** Java
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Database Driver:** JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed on your system:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 21 or newer  
* **MySQL Server**: Version 8.0 or newer  
* **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java-compatible IDE

---

### 📅 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TyrantAbhay/Employee_Management_System.git
cd Employee_Management_System
```

2. **Database Setup**

Start your MySQL server, then run the following SQL script to set up the database:

```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE ems;

-- Switch to the new database
USE ems;

-- Create the employee table
CREATE TABLE emsystem (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Salary INT,
    Department VARCHAR(100),
    Position VARCHAR(100)
);
```

3. **Configure Database Credentials**

In your IDE, open the project. The database credentials are currently hardcoded in the `.java` files:

* **URL:** `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ems`
* **Username:** `root`
* **Password:** `9845`

> ⚠️ Either update the password in your MySQL to match `9845` or change it in all relevant Java files.

4. **Run the Application**

* Locate the `Home.java` file inside the `src` directory  
* Open CMD or terminal in the `src` directory, then compile and run using the following commands:
  ```bash
  cd src
  javac -cp ".;mysql-connector-j-9.4.0.jar" *.java
  java -cp ".;mysql-connector-j-9.4.0.jar" Home
* The EMS GUI should now launch
